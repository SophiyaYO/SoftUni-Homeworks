You will be given a list of integer numbers on the first input line.
Until you receive "End" you will be given operations you have to apply on the list. The possible commands are:
•	Add {number} – add number at the end
•	Insert {number} {index}” – insert number at given index
•	Remove {index} – remove at index
•	Shift left {count} – first number becomes last ‘count’ times
•	Shift right {count} – last number becomes first ‘count’ times
