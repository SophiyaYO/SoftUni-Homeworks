Paris has entered Sparta and he has to fight in order to abduct the wife of Menelaus, Helen.
After Paris got into Sparta, he has to fight his way to Helen’s chamber.
In order to do that, he has to walk through the city where dangerous enemies are watching out for threats,
but he also has to be careful not to get exhausted and not be able to proceed with his mission.
If Paris successfully reaches to her chamber, they safely escape from the Spartans.
A standard field of Sparta looks like this:
------H---
-------S--
--S-------
----------
-----P----
P -> Paris, the player character
S -> Spartan, enemy
H -> Helen
- -> Empty space
Each turn proceeds as follows:
•	First, Spartan spawns on the given indices.
•	Then, Paris moves in a direction, which decreases his energy by 1.
o	It can be “up”, “down”, “left”, “right”
o	If Paris tries to move outside of the field, he doesn’t move but still has his energy decreased.
•	If an enemy is on the same cell where Paris moves, Paris fights him, which decreases his energy by 2.
If Paris’ energy drops at 0 or below, he dies and you should mark his position with ‘X’.
•	If Paris kills the enemy successfully, the enemy disappears.
•	If Paris reaches the index where Helen is, they both run away (disappear from the field), even if his energy is 0 or below.
