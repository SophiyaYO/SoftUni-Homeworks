Trojan army marches upon Sparta.
Vicious waves of Trojan warriors are getting ready to attack the Spartan defense and make their way into the city.
First, you will be given a number equal to the waves of Trojan warriors.
On the second line you will be given the plates of the Spartan defense.
Then, on each next line (for each wave), you receive the power of each Trojan warrior.
Additionally, on every third wave, the Spartans build a new plate (extra line with a single integer) before the Trojan
warriors attack. In order to enter the city, the Trojans have to destroy all the plates.
Until there are no more plates or warriors, the last Trojan warrior attacks the first plate:
•	If the warrior’s value is greater, he destroys the plate and lowers his value by the plate’s value, then attacks the next plate, until his value reaches 0.
•	If the plate’s value is greater, the warrior dies and the plate decreases its value by the warrior’s value.
•	If their values are equal, the warrior dies and the plate is destroyed.
