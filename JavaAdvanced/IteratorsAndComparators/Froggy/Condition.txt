Let's play a game. You have a tiny little Frog, and a Lake with numbers.
The Lake and its numbers, you will get by an input from the console.
Imagine, your Frog belongs to the Lake. The Frog jumps only when "END" command is received.
When the Frog starts jumping, print on the console each number the Frog has stepped over. To calculate the jumps, use the guide lines: 
The jumps start from the 0th index.
And follows the pattern - first all even indexes in ascending order(0->2->4->6 and so on) and then all odd indexes in ascending order
(1->3->5->7 and so on). Consider the 0th index as even.
Long story short: Create a Class "Lake", it should implement the interface - "Iterable".
Inside the Lake, create a Class - "Frog" and implement the interface "Iterator". Keep in mind, you will be given integers only.
