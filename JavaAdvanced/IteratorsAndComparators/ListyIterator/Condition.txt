Create a class "ListyIterator", it should receive the collection of Strings which it will iterate, through its constructor.
You should store the elements in a List. The class should have three main functions:
•	Move - should move an internal index position to the next index in the list, the method should return true if
it successfully moved and false if there is no next index.
•	HasNext - should return true if there is a next index and false if the index is already at the last element of the list.
•	Print - should print the element at the current internal index, calling Print on a collection without elements should throw an
appropriate exception with the message "Invalid Operation!". 
By default, the internal index should be pointing to the 0th index of the List.

//Modified condition
Using the ListyIterator from the last problem, extend it by implementing the "Iterable" interface,
implement all methods desired by the interface manually. Add a new method to the class PrintAll(),
the method should foreach the collection and print all elements on a single line separated by a space.
