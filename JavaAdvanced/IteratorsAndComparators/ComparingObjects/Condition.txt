There is a Comparable interface but probably you already know. Your task is simple. Create a Class Person.
Each person should have name, age and town. You should implement the interface - Comparable and try to override the compareTo method.
When you compare two people, first you should compare their names, after that - their age and last but not at least - compare their town.
