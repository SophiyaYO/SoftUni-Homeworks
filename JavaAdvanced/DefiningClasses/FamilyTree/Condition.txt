You want to build your family tree, so you went to ask your grandmother,
sadly your grandmother keeps remembering information about your predecessors in pieces,
so it falls to you to group the information and build the family tree.
On the first line of the input you will receive either a name or a birthdate in the format
"<FirstName> <LastName>" or "day/month/year" - your task is to find information about the person in the family tree.
On the next lines until the command "End" is received you will receive information about your predecessors that you will use it
to build the family tree. 
The information will be in one of the following formats: 
•	"FirstName LastName - FirstName LastName"
•	"FirstName LastName - day/month/year"
•	"day/month/year - FirstName LastName"
•	"day/month/year - day/month/year"
•	"FirstName LastName day/month/year"
The first 4 formats reveal a family tie – the person on the left is parent to the person on the right
(as you can see the format does not need to contain names,
for example the 4th format means the person born on the left date is parent to the person born on the right date).
The last format ties different information together – i.e. the person with that name was born on that date.
Names and birthdates are unique – there won’t be 2 people with the same name or birthdate,
there will always be enough entries to construct the family tree
(all people names and birthdates are known and they have atleast one connection to another person in the tree). 
After the command "End" is received you should print all information about the person whose
name or birthdate you received on the first line – his name, birthday, parents and children (check the examples for the format).
The people in the parents and children lists should be ordered by their first appearance in the input
(regardless if they appeared as a birthdate or a name, for example in the first input Stamat is before Penka because he
first appeared in the second line, while she appears in the third.).
