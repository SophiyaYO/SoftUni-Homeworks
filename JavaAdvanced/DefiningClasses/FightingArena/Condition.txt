For this problem you should create a new package named "arena",  which should hold inside the classes Gladiator , Stat, Weapon and FightingArena.
Create Java class Weapon that has the following structure:
•	size: int
•	solidity: int
•	sharpness: int
•	Getter getSize()
•	Getter getSolidity()
•	Getter getSharpness()

Create Java class Stat that has the following structure:
•	strength: int
•	flexibility: int
•	agility: int
•	skills: int
•	intelligence: int
•	Getter getStrength()
•	Getter getFlexibility()
•	Getter getAgility()
•	Getter getSkills()
•	Getter getIntelligence()

Create Java class  Gladiator that has the following structure:
•	name:  String
•	stat:  Stat
•	weapon:  Weapon
•	Getter getName()
•	Getter getStatPower() : int – return the sum of the stat properties 
•	Getter getWeaponPower(): int - return the sum of the weapon properties.
•	Getter getTotalPower(): int - return the sum of the stat properties plus the sum of the weapon properties
•	Method toString() which returns the information about a single Gladiator object in the following format:
"{gladiatorName} – {gladiatorTotalPower}"
"  Weapon Power: {gladiatorWeaponPower}"
"  Stat Power: {gladiatorStatPower}"

Write a Java class FightingArena that has gladiators (a collection which stores the entity Gladiator).
All entities inside the arena have the same properties

•	Field gladiators – collection that holds added entities
•	Field name - String
•	Method add(entity) – adds an entity to the Data
•	Method remove(name) – removes an entity by given Gladiator name.
•	Method getGladiatorWithHighestStatPower() – returns the Gladiator which poses the Stat with the highest stat power.
•	Method getGladiatorWithHighestWeaponPower() – returns the Gladiator which poses the Weapon with the highest weapon power.
•	Method getGladiatorWithHighestTotalPower() – returns the Gladiator who has the highest total power.
•	Getter getCount – returns the number of stored entities
•	?verride toString() in following format:
"{arenaName} – {countOfGladiators} gladiators are participating."
