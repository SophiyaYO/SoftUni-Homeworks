A Pizza is made of a dough and different toppings. You should model a class Pizza which should have a name, dough
and toppings as fields. Every type of ingredient should have its own class.
Every ingredient has different fields: the dough can be white or wholegrain and in addition it can be crispy, chewy
or homemade. The toppings can be of type meat, veggies, cheese or sauce. Every ingredient should have a weight
in grams and a method for calculating its calories according its type. Calories per gram are calculated through
modifiers. Every ingredient has 2 calories per gram as a base and a modifier that gives the exact calories.
Your job is to model the classes in such a way that they are properly encapsulated and to provide a public method
for every pizza that calculates its calories according to the ingredients it has.
For example, white dough has a modifier of 1.5, a chewy dough has a modifier of 1.1, which means that a white
chewy dough weighting 100 grams will have (2 * 100) * 1.5 * 1.1 = 330.00 total calories.
For example, meat has a modifier of 1.2, which means that a meat weighting 50 grams will have (2 * 50) * 1.2 =
120.00 total calories.
Data Validation must be in the order of the Input Data.
  If invalid flour type or an invalid baking technique is given an exception is thrown with the message "Invalidtype of dough.".
  If dough weight is outside of range [1..200] throw an exception with the message "Dough weight should bein the range [1..200].".
  If topping is not one of the provided types throw an exception with the message "Cannot place {name of
invalid argument} on top of your pizza.";
  If topping weight is outside of range [1..50] throw an exception with the message "{Topping type name}
weight should be in the range [1..50].".
  If name of the pizza is empty, only whitespace or longer than 15 symbols throw an exception with the
message "Pizza name should be between 1 and 15 symbols.".
  If number of topping is outside of range [0..10] throw an exception with the message "Number of toppingsshould be in range [0..10].".
The input for a pizza consists of several lines:
  On the first line is the pizza name and the number of toppings it has in format:
  Pizza {pizzaName} {numberOfToppings}
  On the second line you will get input for the dough in format:
  Dough {flourType} {bakingTechnique} {weightInGrams}
  On the next lines, you will receive every topping the pizza has, until an "END" command is given:
  Topping {toppingType} {weightInGrams}

If creation of the pizza was successful print on a single line the name of the pizza and the total calories it has,
rounded to the second digit after the decimal point.
