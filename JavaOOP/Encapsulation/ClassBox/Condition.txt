You are given a geometric figure Box with fields length, width and height. Model a class Box that can be
instantiated by the same three parameters. Expose to the outside world only methods for its surface area, lateral
surface area and its volume.
On the first three lines you will get the length, width and height. On the next three lines print the surface area,
lateral surface area and the volume of the box.
A box’s side should not be zero or a negative number. Add data validation for each parameter given to the
constructor. Make a private setter that performs data validation internally.
