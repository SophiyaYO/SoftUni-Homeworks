You should be familiar with encapsulation already. For this problem, you’ll need to create class called Chicken.
Chicken should contain several fields, a constructor, and several methods. Your task is to encapsulate or hide
anything that is not intended to be viewed or modified from outside the class.
Chicken lives for 15 years. Chicken have name for sure, at least 1 symbol long. Chicken producing eggs:
  First 6 years it produces 2 eggs per day [0 - 5]
  Next 6 years it produces 1 egg per day [6 - 11]
  And after that it produces 0.75 eggs per day
