Create a hierarchy(package) of animals. Your program should have three different animals – Dog, Frog and Cat.
Deeper in the hierarchy you should have two additional classes – Kitten and Tomcat. Kittens are "Female" and
Tomcats are "Male". All types of animals should be able to produce some kind of sound - String
produceSound(). For example, the dog should be able to bark. Your task is to model the hierarchy and test its
functionality. Create an animal of each kind and make them all produce sound.
You will be given some lines of input. Each two lines will represent an animal. On the first line will be the type of
animal and on the second – the name, the age and the gender. When the command "Beast!" is given, stop the
input and print all the animals in the format shown below.
